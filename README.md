The above source code is for a backupscript using python.
It has a GUI from tkinter.
How it operates-A user selects the folder which is to be backed up,then select the target folder to create the backup folder.
On clicking start-backup the script creates a folder named(backup_timestamp).
Fell free to make any developmental changes.
Enjoy!
